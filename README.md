# Risk-Based-Insurance-Cost-Model

Overview:

The Risk-Based Insurance Cost Model is a machine learning project designed to predict the insurance costs for individuals based on various risk factors. This project utilizes regression techniques to analyze and model the relationship between a person's attributes—such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region of residence—and the cost of their insurance premiums.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw data to make it suitable for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand the data, uncovering trends and relationships among features.
Regression Model: Implementation of various regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression to predict insurance costs.
Feature Importance: Analysis of which factors most significantly impact insurance costs.
